# Advanced Docking System
Developed by Manuel Freiholz


## Notes
- SectionContent may safe a "size-type" property, which defines how the size of the widget
  should be handled.
  - PerCent: Resize in proportion to other widgets.
  - Fixed: Width or height are fixed (based on orientation).
  

## TODO / Issues
[ ] Drop indicator images should be fully visible over the DropOverlay rectangle.
[ ] Clean up of unused e.g. count()<=1 QSplitters doesn't work well.
