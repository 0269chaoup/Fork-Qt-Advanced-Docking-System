# Advanced Docking System for Qt

Manages content widgets more like Visual Studio or similar programs.
I also try to get everything done with basic Qt functionality.
Basic usage of QWidgets an QLayouts and using basic styles as much as possible.

## Tested Compatible Environments
- Windows 10

## Build
Open the `build.pro` with QtCreator and start the build, that's it.
You can run the demo project and test it yourself.

## Release & Development
The `master` branch is not guaranteed to be stable or does not even build, since it is the main working branch.
If you want a version that builds, you should always use a release/beta tag.
